            <h2 class="htwo">Early Life</h2>
            <h5>Christopher Edward Nolan was born on 30 July 1970, in Westminster, London. His father, Brendan, was a
                British advertising executive who worked as a creative director. His mother, Christina, was an American
                flight attendant from Evanston, Illinois; she would later work as a teacher of English. He has an elder
                brother, Matthew, and a younger brother, Jonathan, also a filmmaker. The three were raised Catholic in
                London and would spend their summers in Evanston. Nolan has both UK and US citizenship.[2][3]

                Growing up, Nolan was particularly influenced by the work of Ridley Scott and the science fiction films
                2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Star Wars (1977).[4][5] He would repeatedly watch the latter film and
                extensively research its making.[6] Nolan began making films at the age of seven, borrowing his father's
                Super 8 camera and shooting short films with his action figures.[7] These films included a stop motion
                animation homage to Star Wars called Space Wars. He cast his brother Jonathan and built sets from "clay,
                flour, egg boxes and toilet rolls".[4] His uncle, who had worked at NASA building guidance systems for
                the Apollo rockets, sent him some launch footage: "I re-filmed them off the screen and cut them in,
                thinking no-one would notice", Nolan later remarked.[8] From the age of 11, he aspired to be a
                professional filmmaker.[9] Between 1981 and 1983, Nolan enrolled at Barrow Hills, a Catholic prep school
                in Weybridge, Surrey.[10] In his teenage years, Nolan started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic.
                Nolan and Roko co–directed the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union, an
                independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service.[a][12][13]

                Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath,
                Hertfordshire, and later studied English literature at University College London (UCL). Opting out of a
                traditional film education, he pursued "a degree in something unrelated", which his father suggested
                "gives a different take on things".[14] He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which
                comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16 mm film cameras.[15] Nolan was president of the Union's Film
                Society,[15] and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened feature films of 35 mm
                during the school year and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers.[16]</h5>

            <h2 class="htwo">Career</h2>
            <h5>After earning his bachelor's degree in English literature in 1993, Nolan worked as a script reader,
                camera operator and director of corporate videos and industrial films.[15][17][18] He directed, wrote
                and edited the short film Larceny (1996),[19] which was filmed over a weekend in black and white with
                limited equipment and a small cast and crew.[12][20] Funded by Nolan and shot with the UCL Union Film
                society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's
                best shorts.[21] For unknown reasons, the film has since been removed from public view.[19] Nolan filmed
                a third short, Doodlebug (1997), about a man seemingly chasing an insect with his shoe, only to discover
                that it is a miniature of himself.[14][22] Nolan and Thomas first attempted to make a feature in the
                mid-1990s with Larry Mahoney, which they scrapped.[23] During this period in his career, Nolan had
                little to no success getting his projects off the ground, facing several rejections; he added,
                "[T]here's a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place ...
                Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry."[24]
                Impressed by his work on Memento, filmmaker Steven Soderbergh recommended Nolan to Warner Bros. to
                direct the psychological thriller Insomnia (2002), although the studio initially wanted a more seasoned
                director.[45] A remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name, the film is viewed as "the
                outlier of Nolan's filmography" due to its perceived lack of unconventionality he is known for.[46]
                Starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank,[47] Insomnia follows two Los Angeles detectives
                sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a local teenager. It received positive
                reviews from critics and earned $113 million against a budget of $46 million.[48][49] Film critic Roger
                Ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt,
                adding, "Unlike most remakes, the Nolan Insomnia is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the
                material, like a new production of a good play."[50] Richard Schickel of Time deemed Insomnia a "worthy
                successor" to Memento and "a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery".[51] Following,
                Memento and Insomnia established Nolan's image as an "auteur".[52] After the lattermost, he wrote a
                screenplay for a Howard Hughes biopic. Nolan reluctantly tabled his script after learning that Martin
                Scorsese was already making one such film: The Aviator (2004).[53] He turned down an offer to direct the
                historical epic Troy (2004).[54]

                    <h4>Intersteller</h4>
                    <h8>One of the reasons Interstellar is so beloved is because of its scientific accuracy. The idea of
                        time dilation due to gravity on the behemoth planet, wormholes, and even the black hole shown
                        was ahead of its time.</h8>

                    <h4>Inception</h4>
                    <h8>Inception is the far better film, while Interstellar is the far greater. Inception is almost
                        perfectly executed from start to finish, but thematically it's relatively modest.</h8>

                    <h4>Prestige</h4>
                    <h8>The aspect that truly sets The Prestige apart from the rest of Nolan's filmography is his acute
                        focus on character. The performances are spellbinding in their own right, but it's the way that
                        Nolan manipulates these characters to both communicate the film's key themes and achieve his
                        purpose that proves crucial.</h8>

                    <h4>Tenet</h4>
                    <h8>If you are into movies, Tenet is your jam. If you want to enjoy an intriguing and interesting
                        film which does tribute to many genres and film-making techniques, then TENET is a great choice.

                    <h4>Memento</h4>
                    <h8>The “Memento” viewing experience is as disorienting as the film itself, and it is worth every
                        minute. Have you ever watched a movie and thought to yourself, “This makes absolutely no sense,
                        I have no idea what is happening!” If the answer is “no,” that is about to change.</h8>

            <h2 class="htwo">Personal Life</h2>
            <h5>Nolan is married to Emma Thomas, whom he met at University College London when he was 19.[9][16] She has
                worked as a producer on all of his films since 1997.[43][162] The couple have four children and reside
                in Los Angeles.[163]

                Rarely granting promotional interviews about his films, Nolan prefers to maintain a certain level of
                mystery about his work.[164] Refusing to discuss his personal life,[165] he feels that too much
                biographical information about a filmmaker detracts from the experience of his audiences. "I actually
                don't want people to have me in mind at all when they're watching the films." Author Stuart Joy felt
                that Nolan's unwillingness to talk about his personal life shows a desire for control, one of the
                recurring themes in his work.[164]

                Nolan was physically assaulted by fellow filmmaker David O. Russell in 2003 at a party in Hollywood. The
                latter reportedly put Nolan in a headlock and wrapped his arm around Nolan's neck.[166][167]</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="early section">
            <h2 class="htwo">Film Making Style</h2>
            <h5>Nolan's films are majorly centred in metaphysical themes, exploring the concepts of time, memory and
                personal identity.[168][169] His work is characterised by mathematically inspired ideas and images,
                unconventional narrative structures, materialistic perspectives, and evocative use of music and
                sound.[d] Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro called Nolan "an emotional mathematician".[174] BBC's arts editor
                Will Gompertz described him as "an art house auteur making intellectually ambitious blockbuster movies
                that can leave your pulse racing and your head spinning".[175] Joseph Bevan wrote, "His films allow
                arthouse regulars to enjoy superhero flicks and multiplex crowds to engage with labyrinthine plot
                conceits."[97] Nolan views himself as "an indie filmmaker working inside the studio system".[176]</h5>
